<PageTitle>Contents - Tavenem Blazor Framework</PageTitle>

<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H1">Contents</Heading>

<p>
    The contents component displays a list of headings on the current page, with
    links to each of them.
</p>

<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H2">Basics</Heading>

<p>
    Use the <code>Contents</code> component to create a table of contents for
    the current page. The list is built automatically by examining the current
    page for <a href="./components/heading">Heading</a> components. It will be
    re-built on any page navigation, but not if the page is changed dynamically.
</p>

<p>
    The list of headings is refreshed on page navigation, but does not respond
    to dynamic changes of the current page's contents. If one of your pages
    might have headings which change dynamically, you can call the
    <code>RefreshHeadingsAsync</code> method on a <code>Contents</code>
    component to force it to refresh its list of headings.
</p>

<p>
    You can make a <code>Contents</code> component responsive by setting the
    <code>Breakpoint</code> parameter to the breakpoint at which the list should
    be visible. When set to <code>None</code> (the default) the list is visible
    at all breakpoints.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>ThemeColor</code> parameter can be set to control the color theme
    of the list.
</p>

<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H2">Layout</Heading>

<p>
    The <code>FrameworkLayout</code> component has a built-in
    <code>Contents</code> component. It is positioned after the main content
    (typically on the right-hand side of a page), and will automatically share
    the <code>ThemeColor</code> of the parent <code>FrameworkLayout</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>Breakpoint</code> parameter of the built-in <code>Contents</code>
    component can be set with the <code>ContentsBreakpoint</code> parameter of
    <code>FrameworkLayout</code> (it defaults to <code>Lg</code>). There is one
    key difference, however: when set to <code>None</code> the table of contents
    is hidden completely, rather than displayed at all breakpoints. This allows
    you to suppress the built-in list (possibly in order to use it differently
    in your own layout).
